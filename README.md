# Snore-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project uses deep learning techniques (Simple CNN &amp; MobileNetV2) to detect snoring sounds from 1-second audio clips by converting them into spectrograms. The goal is to develop an effective and lightweight model that could be deployed in real-world healthcare applications such as sleep monitoring and early detection of sleep disorders.
